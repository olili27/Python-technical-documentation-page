                <p>Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of software development besides web development. <br> Python is easy-to-read and powerful, it includes high-level data structures, dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and many more features that make it as useful for complex application development as it is for scripting that connects components together. </p>
                <p>Python can be used for things like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Back-end(or server-side) web and mobile development </li>
                        <li>Desktop app and software development</li>
                        <li>Processing big data and performing mathematical computations</li>
                        <li>Writing scripts(or creating instructions that tell a computer system to "do" something)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Below is a list of some of the prequisites for you:</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The difference between Front-end and Back-end development</li>
                        <li>Understand what you can with Python</li>
                        <li>Install Python (on your PC Mac) </li>
                        <li>Python 2 vs. Python 3 - Know the difference</li>
                        <li>You can be a Python developer without knowing "everything" about Python</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                    <h3>Hello World</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Python has a straight forwad syntax, it encourages a programmer to program without a boilerplate(prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" command - it simply outputs a line of code(and also includes a newline).</p>
                <p>To get started with writing Python, just open a text editor of your choice and write this code:</p>
                <code>print("Hello World")</code>
                <p>Then hit the run button to see the output.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header class="section-header">
                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Variables are symbolic names for values in your application,they are reserved memory locations for storing values. <br> In simple terms, variables are names given to objects, so that it becomes easy to refer to a value(in otherwards a variable points to an object since "Every variable in Python is an object")</p>
                <p>Unlike other programming languages, Python has no <command>for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. <br> Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change the type after they have been set. </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                </p>
                <code>x = 5 <br> y = "John" <br> print(x) <br> print(y)</code> 
                <p>Then hit the run button to see the output.</p>
                <code>x = 5 #x is of type int(integer) <br> y = "John" #y is of type str (string) </code>
